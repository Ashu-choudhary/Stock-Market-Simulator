# Stock-Market-Simulator
Object Oriented Programming Mini-Project
### About
This repository contains the mini-project that was completed by myself for my Object Oriented programming module 

It essentially simulates the increases and decreases in the stock market where the user is able to both buy and sell stocks. The user also has the option of viewing a graph, which provides a visual representation of the price changes for a particular stock. This funcion was implemented through the use of two Java class libraries; JCommon and JFreeChart. Both can be found in the External JAR folder.

An incremental style of development was used, where more and more features were added on based on a given timeline.
